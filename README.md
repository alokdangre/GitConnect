# GitConnect

GitConnect is an AI-powered platform that analyzes open-source contributions, personal repositories, and GitHub activities to surface intelligent insights for developers, recruiters, and collaborators.

## Key Capabilities

- **Developer intelligence:** Build skill maps, contribution summaries, and growth trajectories enriched with LLM insights.
- **Repository analytics:** Benchmark competitiveness, surface trends, and evaluate project health using hybrid Elastic search signals.
- **Personalized updates:** Generate daily, ready-to-post content for platforms like X and LinkedIn based on your activity.

The project is under active development. The backend service lives in `backend/` and currently exposes a simple Express server scaffold as the foundation for future APIs.
